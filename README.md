#Tetris-Like

####How to run:
NOTE: To run this program please ensure that the Java JDK is in your system PATH.

In your desired directory run: `git clone https://github.com/ecortez3/tetris_like.git`

Once files are downloaded, `cd ` into the directory and run the following commands:
 
`   mkdir target;    
    javac src/cortez/personal/*.java -d target/;
    cd target;
    java cortez.personal.Main;
`

This will produce an output in the console, but more importantly, a file will be created with the desired results.

That file can be found in the `/target` directory.
